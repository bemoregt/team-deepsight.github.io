1. Date: 9/24 10:00 AM â€“ 12:00 AM
2. In attendance: 7 persons
3. Agenda: 1) Linear classification: Support Vector Machine, Softma, 2) Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent, 3) Backpropagation, Intuitions 
4. Comments: In the first session, Suyeong explained loss function of SVM and Softmax. We also reviewed three approach for optimization-random search, local random search and follow the gradient. The second session was about backpropagation and neural networks part by Hyungkyu. He drew computational graph of neural network and explained implementation. He also taught us some useful function in python for implementation of neural network.
