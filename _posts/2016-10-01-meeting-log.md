1. Date 10/01 10:00 AM â€“ 12:00 AM
2. In attendance: 7 persons
3. Agenda: Neural Networks Part 1: Setting up the Architecture
4. Comments: This date was about training neural network. Yeongeon explained various kinds of activation functions, and consecutively data processing. His presentation was so detailed and vivid that we could understand programming results in the lecture note. We had difficult time to understand fully about batch normalization. However, we felt that we could build an architecture of neural network, and decided to meet for an assignment.
