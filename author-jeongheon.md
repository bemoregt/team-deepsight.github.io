# Jeongheon Kim

When Jeongheon was 7, his father often enjoyed programming with basic language on Apple II and he started to make a simple program at 9 years old. As he grew up, he even created a music player wih Turbo-C at 12 years old and a snake-like game based on OOP concepts with Borland C++ at 15 years old. He won the top prize in the programming competition organized by the cityâ€™s education office in elementary school and got the second prize in the same competition in middle school. When he became 16, his interest was changed from programming to music composition and began to make computer music with a small keyboard controller and an external sound card.
He had worked at game companies and web portals for over 10 years as a game music composer and a sound-fx designer. Recently he began a programming career and is now developing an algorithmic trading platform with python. He is highly interested in developing a generative music system using deep learning algorithms.
