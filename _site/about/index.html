            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Built in 2016, DeepSight is a team driven to research and implement state-the-of-the-art techniques in deep learning.<br />
We are learning to build, and implement neural networks by studying well-known lectures and recent papers, and gaining cutting-edge knowledge in machine learning. We study materials, and implement neural network models by doing programming assignments.<br />
We have a meeting on a weekly basis to discuss topics and solution together while working on their own professional field. We are going to adapt machine learning model to each member’s professional fields such as finance, image recognition, voice processing, natural language processing, etc.<br />
We would like to share our thoughts and achievement on machine learning here to make it a more open community.</p>

<h3 id="jeongheon-kimauthorjeongheon"><a href="/author/jeongheon/">Jeongheon Kim</a></h3>
<p>When Jeongheon was 7, his father often enjoyed programming with basic language on Apple II and he started to make a simple program at 9 years old. As he grew up, he even created a music player wih Turbo-C at 12 years old and a snake-like game based on OOP concepts with Borland C++ at 15 years old. He won the top prize in the programming competition organized by the city’s education office in elementary school and got the second prize in the same competition in middle school. When he became 16, his interest was changed from programming to music composition and began to make computer music with a small keyboard controller and an external sound card.
He had worked at game companies and web portals for over 10 years as a game music composer and a sound-fx designer. Recently he began a programming career and is now developing an algorithmic trading platform with python. He is highly interested in developing a generative music system using deep learning algorithms.</p>
